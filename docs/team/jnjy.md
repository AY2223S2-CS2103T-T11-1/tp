### Project: Well Informed Fridge Environment (WIFE)
WIFE is always right. Our product Well Informed Fridge Environment (WIFE) helps users to manage their fridge inventory.
With this, one never have to worry about optimizing storage and organization of food items in a refrigerator, thereby reducing 
wastage and improving the efficiency of grocery shopping.

P.S. Never question WIFE.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: 
* Added the ability to list all the created tags.
  * What it does: Displays to the user the list of tags that had been created in WIFE.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can conveniently list
  all the tags that had been created in the system for easier reference. This allows the user to easily
  select the tags that user wish to tag their food item with.
  * Highlights: This feature is useful when the user wish to tag food or filter out food based on the tags
  available.

* **New Feature**:
* Added the ability to add tags to the food items.
  * What it does: Allows the user to add valid tags to any valid food item in WIFE that they wish to categorise.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can conveniently classify
    the food item based on the food's unique characteristic. It also allows for easier search of the food item
    based on the tags allocated for the food item.
  * Highlights: This enhancement allows for easier classification of food item in the fridge and will ease the filtering
    of the food item in the fridge.
