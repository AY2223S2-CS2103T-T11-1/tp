### Project: Well Informed Fridge Environment (WIFE)
WIFE is always right. Our product Well Informed Fridge Environment (WIFE) helps users to manage their fridge inventory.
With this, one never have to worry about optimizing storage and organization of food items in a refrigerator, thereby reducing
wastage and improving the efficiency of grocery shopping.

P.S. Never question WIFE.
